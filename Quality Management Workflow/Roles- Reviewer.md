Every project can have multiple collaborators. A collaborator can be an admin, annotator or reviewer. An admin can annotate and review. An annotator can only annotate, not review. A reviewer is usually a subject matter expert, they can review annotations (and add modifications to annotations)

In Review mode performance of an annotator can be reviewed for every image or video-frame. Review mode gives reviewer to:
1. "Accept" or "Reject" an annotation. 
2. Enter a score between 0 and 10.
3. Leave a comment for the annotator.
