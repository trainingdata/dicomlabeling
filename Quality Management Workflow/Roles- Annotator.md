Every project can have multiple collaborators. A collaborator can be an admin, annotator or reviewer. An admin can annotate and review. An annotator can only annotate, not review. A reviewer is usually a subject matter expert, they can review annotations (and add modifications to annotations)

Annotator can only add or modify annotations. They will also see reviews from reviewers.

Image below shows annotator seeing reviews by a reviewer.
