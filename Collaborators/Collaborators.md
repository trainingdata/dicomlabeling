Deep learning requires millions of images as input. Task of labeling millions of images requires many individuals. These individuals might be freelancers, and they might be located in distant locations. A data-science team needs to engage freelance workforce to complete their tasks.

The Collaborator feature allows data-science team to invite individuals to help with a labeling project. If multiple users are collaborating on an annotating project, TrainingData.io application distributes all of the data attached to a project to the collaborators with access. Collaborators will only get unique data, meaning there will not be multiple annotators annotating the same data.

**Annotator**
The Annotator role can annotate queued data and view their own work from the Activity Table. An annotator cannot view annotators performance or view/modify any aspect of the project configuration or data sources.

**Reviewer**
The Reviewer role extends the annotator role by being able to see and review all annotated data in the project.

**Admin**
The Admin role can add and edit projects, data and Annotators. By default, the user that signs up for an account has the role of Admin.

**Project Based Roles**
 When a user is given a project based role, they don't have access to projects by default. However, the user is granted access to each project with a specific role and the role of each project can be changed. The benefit of this is that you can limit the access and the role of a user depending on the project at your discretion.
