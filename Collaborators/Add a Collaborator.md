A Collaborator is an individual who works on your labeling task. Collaborators can be your teammates at work, or people in other teams like data-science team, product team, devops team, legal team. Collaborators can also be individuals outside your organization like freelance annotators who would do annotation-work requiring skills not available in your organization.
