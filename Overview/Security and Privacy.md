At TrainingData.io we take data security and privacy very seriously. 

We allow you to log in to TrainingData.io application using the same identity provider that you use for other services.

# Data Security
We allow data owners to control who accesses their data. Each annotator's (internal or external) activity is recorded and they are not allowed to download training data. We allow data owners to see complete access log of every collaborator's activity. 

# Single Sign-On
TrainingData.io supports single sign-on (SSO), which allows you to log in to TrainingData.io application using the same identity provider that you use for other services.

# On Premises Solution
We  provide our labeling software as Docker image, it can run as hosted solution in your network. Hosted version of annotation tool can access images that are hosted on local machine, images hosted on local web-server or images hosted in cloud. All training data and resulting labels are saved on local infrastructure. Only project definition sits in cloud.

# Cloud Hosted Solution
You can upload your assets (images and videos) to our cloud. Our cloud is secure with equivalent of HIPAA compliance. (We sign BAA agreement if needed).

# Hybrid Solution
We offer hybrid solution where annotation tool is installed on local infrastructure as Docker instance. Training data is hosted in cloud.
